Therefor a minimum of personal data will be stored on the AirScout server. Most of them is collected from publically available sources. 
Please support the community with details about your station and your QTH. This is your tribute to the community!

AirScout is generating a unique AirScout ID to identify each instance of AirScout running and to generate a temporary session key. 
The ID is just a random number and will remain the same until:

	- a relevant change of your hardware setup and/or Operating System is detected
	- you delete AirScout_Device_ID and/or AirScout_Instance_ID from your AirScout settings or you delete all AirScout settings
	

The following information is collected by this software and is stored in the AirScout User Database per AirScout ID:

	- the unique AirScout ID [primary key]
	- call sign
	- latitude
	- longitude
	- a session key for message encryption
	- AirScout version
	- timestamp of last change (UTC)

The following information is collected by this software and is stored in the AirScout Location Database per user/station and band:

	- call sign
	- latitude
	- longitude
	- grid square
	- source of location information (UNKONWN = 0, FROMLOC = 1, FROMUSER = 2, FROMBESTCASEELEVATION = 3)
	- number of hits (how often this information was found on different reliable sources, e.g. quality of this location information)
	- timestamp of last change (UTC)
	- AirScout ID of reporting instance

The following information is collected by this software and is stored in the AirScout QRV Database per user/station and band:

	- call sign
	- grid square
	- band
	- antenna height
    - antenna gain
    - output power
	- timestamp of last change (UTC)
	- AirScout ID of reporting instance

The data are uploaded either at program startup or on user action. The transfer of the collected data is encrypted via or SSL and is sent to the AirScout web server to be stored in the server database.
All information is kept confidental and is used only to maintain the AirScout global station database and for statistical purposes. 
In case of any change and after successful review of the data an automatic update is redistributed to all AirScout local databases.
No further user tracking, analysis or advertisement is performed.

THE USER ACCEPTS THE FACT THAT HIS REQUEST FOR DELETING OF PERSONAL DATA DOES ONLY AFFECT THE AIRSCOUT GLOBAL DATABASE AND THAT HIS PERSONAL DATA MAY STILL EXIST IN ANY LOCAL DATABASE OF ANY OTHER AIRSCOUT USER.
